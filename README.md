Deviations from Official Requirements
-------------------------------------
This project does not meet the strict eight page requirement because there is only a signle html file. We used hash
navigation and jQuery to create a multiple page effect. This allows us to have pretty transitions between pages. 
Extra care has been taken to allow for the use of bookmarks and the browser's back button.
