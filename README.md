Deviations from Official Requirements
-------------------------------------
This project does not meet the strict eight page requirement because there is only a signle html file. We used hash
navigation and jQuery to create a multiple page effect. This allows for pretty transitions between pages because 
that is important. Extra care has been taken to allow for the use of bookmarks and the browser's back button.

We opted for a search engine friendly text/css logo over an image. It makes use of the free 
[Google Web Fonts](http://www.google.com/fonts), and the font has been localized.

Finally, because it was our intent to make a product so great the department would consider it as a replacement 
for the official Computer Science department website*, we did not include a sound or video file. None seemed
appropriate for the project.


Notes
-----
* [PVAMU style guide](http://www.pvamu.edu/pages/6438.asp#webStyleGuidelines)
* simple [mobile browser detection](http://www.abeautifulsite.net/blog/2011/11/detecting-mobile-devices-with-javascript/) solution


 *This project as it is on the due date, Friday November 22, 2013, is not a valid drop in replacement for the school's
 Computer Science website. Although, it could be a foundation for a new site maintained by Computer Science students.
